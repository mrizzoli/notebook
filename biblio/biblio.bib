  abstract = {The article reconstructs and explains the patterns of collective protest in four Central European countries: former East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia during the early phases of democratic consolidation (1989-93). The method of event analysis of protest behavior is employed. Content analysis of six major newspapers in each country provides empirical evidence. The examination of data reveals striking contrasts in the magnitude and forms of protests. In each country the policies of the new democratic regimes were contested by different groups and organizations, employing different repertoires of contention. The authors consider propositions derived from four theoretical traditions-relative deprivation, instrumental institutionalism, historical-cultural institutionalism, and resource mobilization theory-to determine which provides the best explanation for the patterns observed in the data set. Three main conclusions are reached. First, the levels of "objective" or "subjective" deprivation are unrelated to the magnitude and various features of protest, which are best explained by a combination of institutional and resource mobilization theories. Second, democratic consolidation is not necessarily threatened by a high magnitude of protest, since the two seem to be unrelated. Third, if the demands of collective protest are moderate and the methods routinized, then protest may contribute to the robustness of a new democracy.},

  shorttitle = {Global {{Shadows}}},
  abstract = {Both on the continent and off, ``Africa'' is spoken of in terms of crisis: as a place of failure and seemingly insurmountable problems, as a moral challenge to the international community. What, though, is really at stake in discussions about Africa, its problems, and its place in the world? And what should be the response of those scholars who have sought to understand not the ``Africa'' portrayed in broad strokes in journalistic accounts and policy papers but rather specific places and social realities within Africa?In Global Shadows the renowned anthropologist James Ferguson moves beyond the traditional anthropological focus on local communities to explore more general questions about Africa and its place in the contemporary world. Ferguson develops his argument through a series of provocative essays which open\textemdash{}as he shows they must\textemdash{}into interrogations of globalization, modernity, worldwide inequality, and social justice. He maintains that Africans in a variety of social and geographical locations increasingly seek to make claims of membership within a global community, claims that contest the marginalization that has so far been the principal fruit of ``globalization'' for Africa. Ferguson contends that such claims demand new understandings of the global, centered less on transnational flows and images of unfettered connection than on the social relations that selectively constitute global society and on the rights and obligations that characterize it.Ferguson points out that anthropologists and others who have refused the category of Africa as empirically problematic have, in their devotion to particularity, allowed themselves to remain bystanders in the broader conversations about Africa. In Global Shadows, he urges fellow scholars into the arena, encouraging them to find a way to speak beyond the academy about Africa's position within an egregiously imbalanced world order.},

Basing her work on Ottoman and Iraqi archival sources, the author demonstrates that, contrary to the accepted view, the links between the central state and provincial social groups in fact grew stronger throughout the period. The development and expansion of the system of tax farms and entitlements, for example, bound the provincial service gentry, drawn from mercantile, military and bureaucratic provincial families, to the Ottoman state structure, notwithstanding the apparent weakening of administrative controls. This comparative and broad-ranging book will be of interest to Middle East historians and Ottomanists, as well as to those concerned with the process of state formation in the early modern period.

  abstract = {Designed for general readers with little or no knowledge of Islam, this superb Oxford Dictionary provides more than 2,000 vividly written, up-to-date, and authoritative entries organized in an easy-to-use, A-to-Z format. The Dictionary focuses primarily on the 19th and 20th centuries, stressing topics of most interest to Westerners. What emerges is a highly informative look at the religious, political, and social spheres of the modern Islamic world. Naturally, readers will find many entries on topics of intense current interest, such as terrorism and the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, the PLO and HAMAS. But the coverage goes well beyond recent headlines. There are biographical profiles, ranging from Naguib Mahfouz (the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt) to Malcolm X, including political leaders, influential thinkers, poets, scientists, and writers. Other entries cover major political movements, militant groups, and religious sects as well as terms from Islamic law, culture, and religion, key historical events, and important landmarks (such as Mecca and Medina). A series of entries looks at Islam in individual nations, such as Afghanistan, the West Bank and Gaza, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the United States, and there are discussions of Islamic views on such issues as abortion, birth control, the Internet, the Rushdie Affair, and the theory of evolution. Whether we are listening to the evening news, browsing through the op-ed pages, or reading a book on current events, references to Muslims and the Islamic world appear at every turn. The Oxford Dictionary of Islam offers a wealth of information for anyone curious about this burgeoning and increasingly important world religion.},

  abstract = {"Sharia Incorporated is an ambitious study of how Islamic law traditions have been incorporated into the national legal systems throughout the Muslim world. Both puritan Islamists and Western alarmists tend to oversimplify and misrepresent the role and position of sharia. In response, this book takes stock of the actual legal positions, putting them into their socio-political and historical contexts. The twelve country chapters, each written by laudable international scholars speak to the historical evolution of Islamic, legal, and political ideas and practices. They consider the key legal issues raised by the 'Islamic awakening' of recent decades. Otto's conclusion presents the main findings of this unique comparative study and explains why the incorporation of sharia is such a thorny governance problem for an government in today's Muslim world. It is intended that this wealth of facts and analyses contributes to current debates on sharia, law, and politics"--Publisher's description, p. [4] of cover},

  abstract = {To do so, by discussing the importance of Lerner's ideas for social security, we argue that, in contrast to the findings of the neoliberal model, the solution needed for extended social protection and persistent growth must involve running a social security deficit. We also show the sustainability of the social security deficit in a simple model. Next, we provide a critical review of the literature on social security privatizations and show some negative outcomes for Turkey by discussing the ongoing reform from a radical institutional perspective. We argue that welfare losses incurred by the increasing nonparticipation of the government decrease income certainty for beneficiaries and expose individuals to the risk of fluctuations in the economy in general, and of the stock market in particular. Next, we use an autoregressive stochastic model in order to show the effect of some disadvantages for women on retirement benefits in Turkey under different scenarios. Our findings show that without any modifications in favor of women, the current individual pension system perpetuates and deepens the gender gap.},

Evidence is primarily drawn from Andalusi Maliki jurisprudence and from narrative and biographical traditional sources as well. Separate chapters examine private and public donations and special importance is given to the analysis of the public goals of the institution, namely, charitative, religious (mosques, rabitas), educational and for the jihad. The book is completed with several appendices including complementary information, translations of Arabic texts and figures. This study provides us with a complete knowledge of several and important issues such as the relevance of Islamic jurisprudence as an historical source, the structure of economic property, the idea of charity, the Islamic concept of general or common interest and the social and juridical role of men of religion.},

Sam Ladner fills the gap by advancing rigorous ethnographic practice that is tailored to corporate settings where colleagues are not steeped in social theory, research time lines may be days rather than months or years, and research sponsors expect actionable outcomes and recommendations. Ladner provides step-by-step guidance at every turn--covering core methods, research design, using the latest mobile and digital technologies, project and client management, ethics, reporting, and translating your findings into business strategies. This book is the perfect resource for private-sector researchers, designers, and managers seeking robust ethnographic tools or academic researchers hoping to conduct research in corporate settings.

Throughout the Middle East, it long served as a major instrument for delivering public goods in a decentralized manner. In principle, the manager of a waqf had to obey the stipulations of its founder to the letter. In practice, the founder's directives were often circumvented. An unintended consequence was an erosion of the waqf system's legitimacy. In any case, legally questionable adaptations proved no substitute for the legitimate options available to corporations. As it became increasingly clear that the waqf system lacked the flexibility necessary for efficient resource utilization, governments found it ever easier to confiscate their resources. In the 19th century, the founding of European-inspired municipalities marked a formal repudiation of the waqf system in favor of government-coordinated systems for delivering public goods.},

  annote = {It is a well established tendency to depict the aftermath of the military intervention of 1980 as an era devoid of any significant labor mobilization. This study aims to shed light on the last important cycle of protest led by the organized labor movement spanning from the mid eighties to the beginning of the nineties. This last process of mobilization contains two of the most noteworthy episodes of labor protest, spring actions and the great march of miners to be exact. These two instancesfrom that overlooked era were usually accounted as spontaneous reactions to the deteriorating living conditions of the workers. This study claims that the second part of the eighties witnessed a protest cycle led by the unionized workers and the dynamics of the mobilization can be understood using the political processmodel of the social movements' literature. It also argues that the main factor instigating the workers to act was a perceived assault on the moral economy of the industrial relations' regime of Turkey, existing mostly in the publicsector. This moral economy is constructed historically andin a mutual interaction between the state, workers and related political developments in three subsequent periodsof the Turkish Republic. Firstly, the late thirties set the pattern of the state led industrialization and the ideological mainframe of the industrial relations; secondly the transition to multi-party politics also determined the circumstances of acceptable union activities and appropriate government responses and finally the introduction of import substitution enlarged the place of the organized labor within the political system. The neoliberal transformation implemented under the {\"O}zal administration targeted this moral economy among other things and trade unions mobilized in these circumstances creating one of the most illustrious momentsof the Turkish labor history}

  annote = {This thesis examines the workers' mobilization in Turkey in 1989 which is known as the 'Spring Demonstrations'. Thesalient characteristics of the demonstrations are that it was the first mass workers' mobilization after the military intervention in 1980. Workers found different types of demonstrations in order to show their grievances.The experience of the workers during the transformation ofthe labor market and during the mobilization is the main focus of the thesis. The economic transformation process began in 1980 with the proclamation of the January 24 decisions and accompanied by the military intervention in September 12.The January 24 decisions represent a transition from import substitution industrialization which had been the prevailing strategy for the twenty years, to export-led growth. The economic transformation changed the lives of the workers radically since the labormarket began to be dominated by low wages, low job security, flexible employment, de-unionization, military rules, rise of informal sector, privatization and unemployment. This thesis evaluates this transformation process which led the workers to mobilize by giving the focus on their perceptions and experiences. 1989 also saw the beginning of a widespread labor movement triggered by the blocking of collective bargaining brought about by theuncooperative stances of employer and employee unions. Surprisingly, given the spontaneous, local, and autonomousnature of the demonstrations, they resulted in not insignificant improvements in the working conditions of the masses. Given the ban on the right to strike in this period, the so-called 'Spring Demonstrations' differed from the previous labor movements. Yet workers found many ways to air their grievances within gaps in the law or, sometimes, contrary to the law. Their actions were colorful, brave, and creative: they went to the hospital collectively, boycotted meals, grew mustaches and beards, symbolically sold their children to illustrate their inability to meet family obligations or sued for mass divorce claiming they were unable to maintain a family. Inthis thesis, workers' agency, their strategy, cultural practices, resistance tactics, and 'cultures of solidarity' among workers are evaluated in cultural terms inspired by E.P. Thompson}

They consider the possibilities with Islamic legal and human rights systems for the development of inclusive, pro-poor and innovative approaches to land rights. They also focus on Muslim women's rights to property and inheritance systems. Engaging with institutions such as the Islamic endowment (waqf) and principles of Islamic microfinance, they test the workability of "authentic" Islamic proposals. Located in human rights as well as Islamic debates, this study offers a well researched and constructive appraisal of property and land rights in the Muslim world.},

It contains analysis of the recent key works by the Azerbaijani scholars who based their research on the previously unavailable documents from the Baku and Moscow archives. Although the new facts discovered by them fill the lacunae in the historiography on the Iranian-Russian conflict on the "Azerbaijani question" after WWII, certain selectiveness of the materials and their interpretation reveal the authors' involvement into the search for a new identity of the Azerbaijani nation and Azerbaijan as a state. The article dwells upon the geo-political situation around Iran and the Caucasus in the 20th century, covering in detail the unofficial policies of Moscow in the north of Iran and its deliberate creation of the "question of Southern Azerbaijan", the role of the Soviet Azerbaijani leaders and their activities in the Iranian province Azerbaijan, as well as the difference between approaches of Moscow and Baku towards the "liberation of Southern Azerbaijan". The author draws the line on how the "question of Southern Azerbaijan" can be used by contemporary Azerbaijani politicians to manipulate public domain.},

I argue that the lives of workers are situated in two domains, home and work, and family and union membership respectively become the sources of agency coupled with a discourse of blame. The discourse of blame, which is the daily form through which a sense of impotence among workers, is consciously used by unionised workers under the leadership of union representatives. This serves the construction of an imaginary community of workers based onthe idea of a society in harmony and balance. The$\cdot$ broader historical context in which my study can be situated in Turkey's post-1980 period. In this period, export oriented industrialism went hand in hand with a kind of de-industrialisation and adoption of flexible production techniques both of which undermined the power of trade unions and the discourse of the welfare state. Thus my study can be understood as an attempt to demonstrate a moment of un ionised workers' responses to these processes. My thesis is based on a fieldwork that took place between September 1999 and June 2001, in a factory, which produces electronic spare parts in Sefakoy.I also visited frequently the union centre in Aksaray. It mainly depended on in-depth interviews and observations inthe factory but I also attended a few leisure activities outside the factory and meetings in the union centre}

We explain these variations through a political economy approach to public finance, identifying factors affecting economic power and its constraints. An influential interest group capable of affecting the ruler's power was the legal community (`ulam{\=a}'). This community could increase the ruler's ability to extract a surplus from the citizenry by conferring legitimacy, thereby lowering the cost of collecting taxes. It could also limit power through legal constraints on taxation. We show how changes in legitimacy and legal constraints affected the economic power of rulers in representative episodes of Islamic history and identify general trends and dynamic processes underlying the relationship between the state and the legal community.},

Based on a discursive analysis of the publications of these organizations, it traces the changing mood of the capitalist class in social and political realms as well as in the area of industrial relations. Due to strong unionization and rising worker militancy, the associations were socially timid, ineffective in the political arena and unable to develop astrategy to confront the labor movement in the pre-1980 period. The military intervention in 1980, however, turnedthe power balance between capital and labor. This process lent the capitalist class a considerable social legitimacyand self-confidence. From 1980 to 2005, the associations enhanced their social prestige by increasing their cultural and social capital, augmented their political strength by developing closer ties with state officials and party leaders and enjoyed their superiority over laborunions that were seriously weakened by the new labor laws.The essential feature of this period is the fact that the capitalist class ceased to remain in defensive lines and initiated a counter-attack that further consolidated its hegemony}

Opponents of this theory point out that this process has not been universal, and that unions in both advanced and new industrialized capitalist economies have proved resilient to the worldwide structural pressures. These scholars have argued that domestic institutions, rather than global pressures, maintain a decisive influence over the success of unionism in global capital. This thesis addresses their arguments through the case of Turkey, first exploring the domestic institutions in advanced capitalist economies and their unions' relative experiences in global capital, then comparing these to theinstitutions common to the import substitution industrialization model used by Turkey previous to its shift to liberalized export-orientated growth. An examination of the historical and contemporary developmentof organized labor in Turkey comes to the conclusion that the domestic institutions needed to sustain unionization in the global economy were not developed by the unions, and this has led to their current weakness and decline in the face of global trends}

  abstract = {Modern social and political thought has approached the questions of politics, law, and citizenship from the vantage point of a fundamental divide between the occidental and oriental, or archaic and modern, institutions. This article creates a concept, the gift of law, by staging two gift-giving practices as two historical moments: Greek euergetism and Ottoman waqf. While it is indebted to Mauss, our articulation of the gift of law also owes to the critical interventions of Jacques Derrida and Pierre Bourdieu, who emphasized non-voluntaristic and non-calculative aspects of the gift. We argue that both euergetism and the waqf enabled and substantiated legal subjectivities that allocated rights and obligations. Those gift-giving practices establish relationships between various groups and legal authorities that were crucial in the formation of cities as spaces of government, for both citizens and non-citizens alike. With the concept `gift of law', categories `oriental' and `occidental' become problematic.},

This volume examines the monetary history of that empire from its beginnings in the fourteenth century to the end of the first world war. Through a detailed examination of the currencies and related institutions of an empire which stretched from the Balkans through Anatolia, Syria, Egypt and the Gulf to the Maghrib, the book demonstrates the complexity of the monetary arrangements and their evolution in response to both local developments and global economic forces. The volume also affords some valuable insights into social and political history and the evolution of Ottoman institutions. This is an important book by one of the most distinguished economic historians in the field.},

Some of these aspects of the informal sector have survived from pre-independence or colonial periods. Others, like kleptocracy and the criminalisation of the state, are outgrowths of the new state and its leadership cadre. These problems largely arise in the so-called juridical state, the legal-rational construct of new statehood, and reflect the failure, or unwillingness of the managers of the new state to move beyond the juridical state to the empirical state, that is, to nationhood and a generalised national identity and citizenship.},

Based on interview data and visits to Gulen-inspired institutions, the book describes the movement from a sociological perspective, especially through the lens of social movement theory. It is the first book, grounded in empirical methodology, to describethe movement to a Western audience.

  abstract = {Unravelling Gramsci makes extensive use of Antonio Gramsci's writings, including his much- overlooked pre-prison journalism, prison letters, as well as his prison notebooks, to provide a fresh approach to understanding his contemporary relevance in the current neoliberal world order. Adam Morton examines in detail the themes of hegemony, passive revolution and uneven development to provide a useful way of analysing the contemporary global political economy, the project of neoliberalism, processes of state formation, and practices of resistance. The book explores the theoretical and practical limitations of how Gramsci's ideas can be used today, offering a broad insight into state formation and the international factors shaping hegemony within a capitalist framework.},

After the promulgation of the Law on Trade Unions this Bureau involved in the founding and functioning of these bodies so that to influence their future development. The activities of this Bureau were not confined to {\.I}stanbul area though outside {\.I}stanbul its organisational initiatives were restricted to public enterprises. The Bureau resorted to various means to exertits influence over the trade unions. The major tools used in this way are also exposed. These include the regional trade union federation established in {\.I}stanbul, and a weekly newspaper, H{\"u}rbilek, published first by the Bureau itself, and then transferred to this regional federation. Apart from these two other political and legal arrangements are also evaluated in the context of their connection to industrial relationships. The nature and method of this involvement is analysed from the perspective of corporatism-pluralism dichotomy. The existence of the features of these ideal typical constructs is explored in order to sketch the framework within which the process of governmental interference operated. The study is concluded by the discussion of the dominant pattern of industrial relationships applied during the formative era of the trade unions and its consequences}

  abstract = {Focussing on events in the Anatolian town of Tokat during the final two decades of the great Ottoman legal and administrative reforms known as the Tanzimat (1839-76), this book applies elements of social networking theory to analyze and assess the establishment of local governments across the Middle East. The author's key finding is that the state's efforts to centralize authority succeeded only when and where locals acted as the primary agents of change. Independent notables, such as the military a`y{\^a}n, demanded wealth and state offices in exchange for meting out reform measures according to local idioms of power. Newly created administrative bodies also offered greater social mobility to a growing multiconfessional middle-class in small towns like Tokat. The state was desparate to reform, but opportunistic provincials were eager to have it only on their own terms. Challenging false assumptions about the limited scope of participatory politics in the Middle East during the nineteenth century, Ottoman Notables and Participatory Politics will be of interest to students and scholars of Political Economy, History and Middle East Studies.},

With signed articles by experts in the field, this comprehensive one-volume resource also includes essential information regarding imperialism and the emerging Balkan, Arab, and Turkish nationalism; the demise of the empire; and Ottoman legacy in the Balkans and the Middle East.

  abstract = {The Anthropology of Welfare provides an overview of what anthropology has to offer welfare studies and vice-versa. Case studies from anthropologists in the field, examine different branches of welfare and community care, for example: * Maternity services * Children with learning difficulties * Children's homes * Mothers' centres * People with HIV * Mental health centres * Housing * Care and provision for the elderly. Contributors focus on comparative welfare systems - examples are taken from urban and rural areas of the UK, USA, Sweden, Germany, Portugal, and New Zealand. In each case the theoretical and methodological appropriateness of social anthropology for the study of welfare, and the insights gained by bringing anthropology and welfare together are examined. The Anthropology of Welfare will be essential reading for those studying anthropology, social work and social policy and will be of interest to teachers, practitioners and researchers in applied social welfare fields.},

  shorttitle = {Economic {{Life}} in {{Ottoman Europe}}},
  abstract = {Of the various monopolies exercised by the Ottoman ruling stratum in their long domination over South-eastern Europe, the most lasting in its effects was their monopoly over information. The scanty knowledge that outsiders had of this area improved only in the nineteenth century as, one after another, the Balkan nations regained independence and, with it, their identities. Well into the twentieth century, historians made do with very incomplete information about the period prior to the national revivals of the last century. The result was a tendency to offer disturbingly impoverished and flattened views of provincial life under Ottoman rule, inviting doctrinaire distortions of these eclipsed centuries. In this book, originally published in 1982, Bruce McGowan presents material concerning this neglected area. His painstaking study of Ottoman records provides convincing analyses of economic, fiscal and demographic questions fundamental to our understanding of the region.},

  abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this article is to provide a concise and brief introduction to the classical Islamic law of waqf. This study is based on the Fiqh literature of four Sunni schools of thought. The primary focus is on the Ḥanaf\={\i} Fiqh, however, representative texts of the other schools have also been taken into account. There are three major findings in this article. First, the law contained in Fiqh texts is incomplete because it does not encompass ʿurf (custom) and q{\=a}n{\=u}n (imperial decrees). Custom is recognised in these texts in support of Fiqh, but q{\=a}n{\=u}n is totally missing despite references to the power of rulers regarding certain provisions of waqf law. Second, the legal theory is inconsistent, as the majority of jurists hold that the ownership of a founder terminates with the creation of a waqf. However, not only the founder and his legal heirs maintain a limited proprietary interest in waqf property; the waqf also dissolves with the apostasy of its founder. Third, family awq{\=a}f (pl. of waqf) come into direct conflict with the law of inheritance and the law of gifts. However, the testamentary waqf and waqf during terminal illness are subservient to inheritance law, and jurists have tried to harmonise waqf law with inheritance law whenever an opportunity arose.},

  abstract = {In the former Soviet republics of central Asia, ethnic Russians have exhibited higher adult mortality than native ethnic groups (e.g., Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek) in spite of the higher socioeconomic status of ethnic Russians. The mortality disadvantage of ethnic Russians at adult ages appears to have even increased since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The most common explanation for this "Russian mortality paradox," is that deaths are better reported among ethnic Russians. In this study, we use detailed mortality data from Kyrgyzstan between 1959 and 1999 to evaluate various explanations for the Russian mortality paradox: data artifacts, migration effects, and cultural effects. We find that the most plausible explanation is the cultural hypothesis because the personal behaviors that appear to generate a large part of the observed mortality differences (alcohol consumption, in particular) seem to be closely tied to cultural practices. We examine the implications of this finding for understanding the health crisis in post-Soviet states.},

They have presented the League of Nations and the campaigns of internationally-minded groups as idealistic failures in an age that was characterised by international tension and aggressive nationalisms. This book challenges such narratives by assessing transnational projects that were launched or transformed after World War One, particularly the interaction of the League of Nations with specific groups or associations. The authors reveal the different rationales and stimuli for international cooperation in this period. With fresh research from several European countries, this book makes an original contribution to the transnational history of the interwar years.},
