	abstract = {The article studies the contemporary Azerbaijani historiography on the "question of Southern Azerbaijan" after WWII in connection to the nation-state building processes currently underway in the Republic of Azerbaijan. It contains analysis of the recent key works by the Azerbaijani scholars who based their research on the previously unavailable documents from the Baku and Moscow archives. Although the new facts discovered by them fill the lacunae in the historiography on the Iranian-Russian conflict on the "Azerbaijani question" after WWII, certain selectiveness of the materials and their interpretation reveal the authors' involvement into the search for a new identity of the Azerbaijani nation and Azerbaijan as a state. The article dwells upon the geo-political situation around Iran and the Caucasus in the 20th century, covering in detail the unofficial policies of Moscow in the north of Iran and its deliberate creation of the "question of Southern Azerbaijan", the role of the Soviet Azerbaijani leaders and their activities in the Iranian province Azerbaijan, as well as the difference between approaches of Moscow and Baku towards the "liberation of Southern Azerbaijan". The author draws the line on how the "question of Southern Azerbaijan" can be used by contemporary Azerbaijani politicians to manipulate public domain.},
