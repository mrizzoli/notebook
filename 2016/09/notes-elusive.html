                    <p>Reference: <span class="citation" data-cites="lichterman_elusive_2005">(Lichterman 2005)</span></p>
<p>From Putnam’s study on civil society in Italy and in America we see how civic group membership has been dropping since 1960s, Lichterman argues that the concept of social capital is not fully adequate to address the issue at hand. In his argument Liechtermann sustains that it’s also important to look at the kind and the different meanings of ties that civic groups can build and how these ties can “contribute to a greater civic togetherness in America”. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My goal was to understand how different meanings that group gave to ties might influence the relationship they could create as they reached beyond the group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also draws a distintion between the political analysis of social problems and the set of customs and practices employed to address them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned that volunteering often did not build community [..] cultural customs played a subtle, important role in making a broader togetherness elusive for most of the groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the idea of participation in civic groups as decribed by Alexis de Tocqueville these have been seen as playing a prominent role in bolstering social solidarity and building a greater community (“<em>local workshops of social solidarity</em>”). But as the author noticed during his fieldwork this assumption is not necessarily and always true, two of the three groups he observed couldn’t eventually create those ties with the broader community, not even among themselves as the groups and meetings were discontinued. So the natural question that arises from this observation is, how the group that succeeded was different from those who failed? To which degree the interactions between groups’ members influenced the chance of success of spiraling outwards to build greater social ties?</p>
<p>Two main questions are addressed by this study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The social spiral argument, which states that as individuals join civic groups they <em>tend to</em> create enduring relationships with other group’s members as well as with other individuals who they wouldn’t have met under normal circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Broader ties cultivated by civic groups help to empower civil society, ultimately increasing the collective decision-making responsibilities people carry in their capacity as citizens</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the arguments of this book is to propose that the meanings of the social ties built matter at least as much as the ties themselves. A secondary one is “<em>how people bring religion into public life</em>” and how religion might influence the ways individuals interact (the groups’ cutsoms, or customary practices) during groups’ activities.</p>
<p>According to Putnam’s argument “social capital” is made of three elements: - social networks - norms of reciprocity - trust</p>
<p>The decline in participation to civic groups is worrying because it is supposed to create social capital, and consequently it bolster civic consciousness enlarge inter group and inter community ties and increases the possibility for citizens to hold governemnt accountable for it actions.</p>
<p>In his theory, social networks can be divided by two kinds of social capital, the first one being the “bonding”, that is infra group cohesion, the second instead “bridging” the same cohesion between different groups, only the latter creates a successful social spiral.</p>
<p>One criticism to this is that the category is so broad that don’t let us analyze it in a critical perspective to understand which actions as well which systemic conditions (i.e. institutional and social) can actually promote social capital. Another important point of criticism regards the circularity of the concept, as a group’s actions promote its social capital but at the same time are part of it, and might appear in some way a tautology in this sense.</p>
<p>Other sociologists observed that civic groups can also create social tunnels instead of social bridges, thus hindering cohesion among citizens, when they are more focused on their members’ shared interests preventing them to actively join and participate in civil society as a whole. According to Jason Kauffman civic groups can build moats instead of bridges (cit. pg 29) as he noticed in civic clubs based on different backgrounds and ethnicities that were increasing differences. Neo-Tocquevillians’ defense against this argument is that this kind of civic groups can be considered an outlier, and exception to the norm that belongs to some sort of dark side of civil society. But this approach can’t answer and is not productive in addressing the main question of how and what let a civic group to start the social spyral, especially refusiong to analyze the different dynamics of different groups removing some of them <em>a priori</em> from the study.</p>
<p>So one of the main question under scrutiny here is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is casual, serial vounteering a good indicator of social capital? (pg 82)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the author puts it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the relationships that constitute social capital sustain a “regular connection among individuals” (Putanm 2000), and is comprised of relationships in which people are “doing with” others. (ibidem)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acceptive passively that any kind of volunteering and associationism creates and bolster social capial has also the implicit consqeuence of regarding any kind of relationship and dynamic developed by volunteers and recipient as a “reguar connection”, and doesn’t analyze its very own nature. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Volunteering in a loosely connected network [..] did not teach us how to create more enduring bridges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question of reflexivity revolves around two key issues, firstly about not investigating ourselves how we act and what drives our actions and secondly about not being able to include difrerent point of views in the discussion thus thwarting the possibility to actualy reach out to a variety of individuals that although are interested in the general topic offer a different reading of it</p>
<p>Sometimes the success of a program whose main goal is to build “bridges” between individuals can’t simply be measured by its material outcome, especially since it might be reached more succesfully by providing some sort of moral support, or “helping the families in small practical ways” (cit. pg 135) that can hardly be accounted for but that might might succeed better in creating enduring connections.</p>
<p>Again, in the case about “adopt a family” program the lack of reflexivity didn’t let the volunteers bridge the gap between them and the families they were trying to help, thus prventing categorizing the ‘poor’ in any other way than their own preconcieved ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thouthgfully sensitive to <em>differences</em> between their families and themselves, the volunteers did not ove from sensitivity to active, reflective curiosity about a biger social world that made “differences” into inequalities, as well as barriers to communication (pg 137).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One criticism is that apparently evangelical groups’ course of action relentelessy rely on the self centered idea that personal action can be sufficnent to address the adressee’s situations one by one ameliorating them just by the strength of the connection, thus leaving out the principal outcome for a positive engagement of civic groups, that is to create bridges, or as Tocqueville put it the positive spiral to social cohesion. This approach is reflected not only in the diffuculties the volunteers face when approaching ‘their’ families but also in the social interactions among group’s memebers among themselves, that are described by the author as ‘awkward’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charity imposed from outside may count as a kind of bridge relationship if the charity is accepted and endures over time, but it hardly empowers social self-orgnization the way Tocquevillians would hope.</p>
