  **A**

  **ÂBÂ - ECDÂD**:Aba is plural of eb and ecdad is plural of cedd.
Eb means father, ancestor and grandfather. In terms of points such as
affiliation and inheritance, '' father '' and '' grandfather '' are
discussed in some matters in law. Affiliation consists of combination
and relation among those who cognate and following come into existence
from each other that it is divided into two parts as tulen and arzen.
Tulen affiliation is combination among descents and accessories such as
father, son and grandchild. Upward persons are descent part of tulen
affiliate and downward persons are accessory party of tulen affiliate.
Arzen affiliate is a combination and relation existing among relatives
which branch without upward from an ancestor.  Combination among
fraternals, nephews, uncles, aunts and their children is a sample
thereof and they are as called havaşi and collateral kinship. With
collateral kinship terms in specified articles this kind of affiliate
relation is stated. Whenever aba and ancestor are expressed descent part
of tulen affiliate is meant and whenever child and descendants are
expressed accessory part of tulen affiliate is meant. 

  **ÂB-KEŞ:** Ab means water, keş derives from ''keşiden'' which
mean to draw. Ab-keş means a person who draws water. A person who
supplies water from wells and fountains to meet water requirement of
charity organizations of foundations.

sewage containers and havruz in hospitals. 

  **ÂDİ GEDİK:** Foundation are gediks other than Haremeyn, that is,
Mekke-Medine ve Mahmud-ı Adlî gediks. As Haremeyn and Mahmud-ı Adlî
foundation gediks contain some legal clauses such as to ensure debt,
they are called as nizamlı gedik.

  **AHFÂD :** is plural of Hafid. Hafid means grandchild. Children
of children of a person and their children are grandchild of the said
person. Since ahfad includes to descendants in every generation, it is
found necessary to expound ahfad term not to understand as descendant of
child as per Article 1 of Arâzî-i Emîrîye ve Mevkûfenin Tevsi-i İntikali
law dated 1284 and it is explained that what is meant from ahfad term by
stating '' in the event that possessors of demesne and entailed lands
does not have children, land their ownership to secondary descendant,
that is, to son and daughter of boys and girls''.

  **AİLE VAKFI (FAMILY FOUNDATION) is** a foundation established for
interest of child, descendant and family members. Family Foundations are
organizations that are established to pay required expenses arising for
the purposes of reaching education and morality of family members and
similar aims in accordance with inheritance law under article 322 of
Civil Code. With last clause of specified article,  all and kind actions
relating to allowance of a property and right to a family which cannot
be assigned again and transferring among family members and combination
with the thought that of implementation of such an action are forbidden.
Both independently and combination allocation of a property to any
family and transfer among family members were permissible according to
previous rules.

  **AKÂR i**s a property such as building, land and garden whose
transportation are impossible to the another place. This kind of
property means real estate. Real Akar consists of land and field.
Including of buildings and trees in Akar is due to being integral part
of ground where they are located. People uses Akar term for real estate
providing rent income. Also gardens used like housing and benefited from
building and fruit individually are called as Akar. This meaning arises
from usage in custom.

  **AKÂRÂT-I MEVKÛFE ( ENTAILED AKARAT):** Akarat term is plural of
Akar term. It means entailed Akars providing income. Entailed properties
are two parts. One part of them müessesat-ı Hayriye ( Charity
Institutions ) and other part of them Akarat-ı Mevkufe ( Entailed Akarat
) mean. Perpetuity, liveliness, monitoring and surveillance of Charity
Institutions, repair and maintenance, expendation and rebuilding are
subject to some expenses.  Akars to income such as caravanserai, bath,
hamlet and garden are dedicated. Required expenses of charity
institutions are covered by incomes to be obtained from these
properties. It is not become inevitable being Akar of property to be
dedicated to meet expenses of charity institutions. It is sometimes
money and requirements are provided with revenues obtained from this
money by running this money. For these purposes either Akar or money are
usually endowed as well as charity institutions.  Revenues of entailed
Akar in foundations which are dedicated for the poor are expended for
their repair and maintenance and the remain part is expended for the
poor as per conditions. 

  **AKÇE (COIN)** According to historical information Akçe is first
Ottoman silver coin issued in the time of Sultan Osman Gazi, one of
sultans of Ottoman.  It is coined in the year 729 H according to Islamic
Calendar in Bursa. Up to that time coins of Seljug Empire were in
circulate on the basis of dirham.  In mentioned date dirham was left and
coin (Akçe ) which means white metallic money in Mongolian language was
accepted. Ten- coin metallic money was available in the period of Fatih
Sultan Mehmet as well as two-coin metallic money was available in the
period of Osman Gazi. From time to time changes occured both in weight
and in carat of coin. These changes are mostly carried out by means of
reducing the weight and carat of the coin, finally this condition causes
to adulterations and imitations. Until 1234 although the coin is
currency in this date issuing of the coin are left due to their
counterfeit are issued and kurus-based procedure is accepted.
Establishment of equivalent of coins circulated in various periods with
metallic money and banknotes which were circulated afterward is a quite
problem. However determining of this equivalent is possible due to
current value of silver, in terms of purchasing power and changes in
prices of goods it is completely very difficult to find its equivalent.
Pursuant to stipulated charge and price in some foundations coin terms
are incidentally seen such as '' give coin so-and -so ''. Instead of
looking their equivalent it is more acceptable to determine amount to be
paid to rightful owners in accordance with ratio by taking into
consideration of incomes and good prices of these foundations.

   **AKİB** means  heel of foot, back of foot. Its plural is a'kab.
That's way children of an individual, their children and children of
children mean akib of that individual. According to custom akib is child
and child of son and child of child. This term does not include in
children of daughters. In brief an individual's akib are his/her father
in terms of affiliation or are those coming until that individual. Those
whose fathers does not come from that individual's child are not deemed
as akib.   This term is incidentally seen in some foundations and it is
commented under custom and as written. For example a person says that ''
revenue of my foundation must be submitted to A and after that says
revenue of my foundation must be submitted to A's akib, as long as
he/she lives A and A' children and children of his/her son after A's
death are entitled to revenue of the foundation. 

  **AKREB** is next-of-kin. Akreb in foundation is next-of-kin in
terms of affiliation. Whoever next-of-kin to founder person in terms of
affiliation and maternity provision is implemented for him/her. For
example child is closer from mother and father. Nevertheless if a person
stipulates to endow all or a part of income of his/her foundation to
his/her akreb or after that the poor, when founder's son and daughter or
one of them or their father and mother come the said incomes are given
to son or daughter but are not given to father and mother. If the
closest relatives are several interest belongs to them in equal. One of
akreb deceases its share is not given to other akreb, it is given to the
poor. If other akreb deceases, next relatives cannot receive anything
and the share leaves for the poor. But if there is an explicitness
related to giving to next persons as el-akreb fe'l akreb this
circumstance is excluding.  For example according to above mentioned
example if founder has a son, a daughter and father son and daughter
receives income of foundation as per condition.  If son dies half share
belonging to him is given to the poor. After that when daughter dies
income completely remains the poor. But if founder says that revenue of
my foundation expend to my akaribim by means of el-akreb fe'l akreb and
after that expend for the poor, in this circumstance since there is not
a child it is given to father. As above mentioned what is meant by akreb
term is the closest relative to foundation in terms of affiliation and
maternity. Akreb does not mean close relative in respect of heredity.
Thus his/her priority does not taking into consideration. Because
heredity uses as base other considerations but does not take notice
affiliation and maternity.  The problem may be summarized by those
general rules: 1- Founder's the closest relative is his/her component,
after that is inherent. But founder's father is preferred to son of his
son and founder's mother and father are preferred to son of their son.
2-  Founder's inherent is antecedent from component of component. But it
is preferred to son of founder's son 3- Founder's component is
antecedent from component of inherent. But son of founder's son and
daughter of founder's daughter are the closest from fraternal. 4- Person
who is affiliated with a degree to foundation is the closest from person
who is affiliated with two degree to foundation. But daughter of
founder's daughter are preferred to son of son of founder's son.

  **AKREB-İ MEKNİYYAT:** Akreb is plural of karib coming to mean
near of kin; mekniyat is plural of mekniyyün coming to mean allegory.
Kinaye means to expound a wording whose meaning is explicit. As third
person pronouns are not understandable adequately their meanings other
than first and second pronouns, this kind of pronouns is expressed as
kinaye and in the absence of a contrary presumption, allegory pronouns
are used for the closest reference. For example if it is written in a
foundation certificate - charter that a creator of waqf stipulated
his/her tevliyet ( management duty regarding foundation's estates)
firstly to himself/herself, afterwards to his/her son M and afterwards
to his/her child, pronounce in child wording belongs to M and it is
decided that intended thing here is M's child. It is not accepted by
belonging to foundation. But related to allegory pronouns if there is an
allegory with which distant relative is intended, in that case allegory
is referred to distant relative according to implication without
ascribing to close relative. For example as indicated in abovementioned
example, if it is expressed that creator of a waqf stipulated tevliyet (
management duty regarding foundation's estates) to his/her son M and
afterwards to his/her child for firstly his/her desire afterward his/her
personality, it is understood that creator of a waqf is intended from
pronoun in expression to his/her child but M through for his/her
personality allegory and this expression requires to be expounded in
this way.

  **AKRİBÂ:** Akriba is plural of karib. Karib comes to mean a
person who is near to creator of waqf. Akriba term includes in born
children after establishment of foundation as well as including in
livingness' at time of foundation. If a creator of waqf says that he/she
stipulated his/her foundation's income to akriba without conforming to
his/her desire, his/her own relative is understood from this expression
in terms of manners and customs.  Children and parents do not include in
akriba term. Because these persons are not called akriba in point of
manners and customs, in other words when akriba is said, the things that
we meant are relatives who are not close to these persons. According to
a judicial opinion, person who is the nearest to akriba in foundation is
preferred and also according to another judicial opinion  it includes in
all relatives -either near relative or distant relative- and they become
right holder in favor of foundation equally. Conditional foundations to
akriba absolutely include in either Muslim or non-Muslim, either rich or
poor, either small or large under any circumstances in the scope of
concept of condition. But akriba term is registered as Muslim and
non-Muslim or rich and poor, practice is realized according to
registration.

foundation.

assigned to municipalities and a regulation is executed in this subject.
Since a full clarity in the law is not available, some conflicts occur
about nonislam cemeteries between municipalities and communities. ( see
Article 160 and regulation)

  **KADI-ASKER(Kadi of Army):** There are approvals and seal of

Kadıaskerlik ( Kadi of Army ) was available in some islam states
formerly. Kadıasker was not apoointed until 1. Murad period in Ottomans.
Before this period belde kadi ( kadi of city or town) would go with army
as Kadil-kuzat and execute  Kadı-asker task. In the Orhan Bey period,
Candarlı Kara Halil Efendi, who is İznik Kadi, had authority over kadis
appointed to cities and towns. Afterwards since soldier is separated to
class' and increases religious works of army during Sultan Murad period,
Candarlı Kara Halil Efendi was appointed as kadiasker. Although there is
a kadiasker until deceased Fatih's sovereignty, kadıaskerlik is
increased two parts under  Anadolu and Rumeli Kadı-askeri title in that
date.

  The biggest bodies of judicial organization were Kazaskers ( Chief
of Judicial Institution, called as Kadiasker). They would follow the
army in cruises commanded by Sultan. When army goes to Europe, Rumeli
Kazaskeri would accompany and when army goes to Asia and Africa, Anadolu
Kazaskeri would accompany. The most important task of Kazaskers was to
execute legal consultancy for sultans. However they would preside
distribution of captures and look after with legal cases arising between
army and its members. Other than these Kazaskers would execute judgeship
duty in capital and judges to be sent to Rumeli was appointed by Rumeli
Kazaskeri and judges to be sent to Anatolia was appointed by Anatolia

  **L**

  **LEYLE-İ BERÂT:** This is fifteenth night of Şaban month meaning
God's mercy and forgiveness night. Believers's prays are accepted and
their sins are forgiven by God in this holy night. Deceased Elmalılı
Hamdi Efendi in explanation of verse "İnnâ enzelnâhu fî
leyleti'l-mübâreke" and deceased Hacı Zihni Efendi in section under
title Kitabu's-salât of his work named "Nimetü'l-İslâm"  make detailed

well as other holy nights.

to Almighty God come to mind, whenever kurbet and worship is said holy
days and nights come to mind. Leyle-i kader is twenty seventh night of

blessed night. That expression takes place in one of hadiths related by
several ways and müttefekunaleyh ( a hadith about which all hadith
scientists agree) hadiths: '' Seek leyle-i kadr in last seven of Ramazan
month'' and  also another hadith tells that: '' Seek leyle-i kadr,
whoever wishes to seek he/she should seek it in last seven of Ramazan
month''. Leyle-i Kadir is a very holy and blessed night. Supreme Being
orders that we inspired Kuran-ı Kerim in Leyle-i Kadir, it is more
benevolent than thousand months.  '' In another hadith that expression
takes place: '' Whoever worships in Leyle-i Kadir, his/her sins
committed in past by him/her will be forgiven''. Due to holiness of this
night, all Muslims worship to God in twenty seventh night of Ramazan
until morning and request God to be forgiven and be happy. For honor and
goodness of this night, some foundations stipulates that Koran will be
read in every Leyle-i Kadir and presented its rewards to all souls and
that mosque and small mosques will be lighted until morning in these
holy nights by lighting candle and lamp.

  **LEYLE-İ Mİ'RÂC:**  It is a holy night when our master called as
Fahr-i kainat has travelled from Mescid-i harâm ( Kaaba) to Mescîd-i
Aksâ ( aaqsa mosque ) and afterwards has risen to âlem-i semâvât (
heavens ) and it corresponds to 27th of Recep month.  Our master has
witnessed to many miraculous events during this travelling in heavens
and five time prayer has became obligation in this night. Mi'râc is one
of our esteemed prophet's miracles as inşikâk-ı Kamer ( split of moon).
When Almighty God's power and greatness take into consideration, Mi'râc
is not an event to be exaggrated and hesitated by believers and
comprehension owners as long as they believe Almighty God's power and
greatness. All muslims celebrates this holy night by worshipping and
making charities and goodness'. See deceased Elmalılı Hamdi Yazır's
Sure-i İsrâ explanation for further information about Mirâc.  

  **LEYLE-İ REGÂİB:** It is first Friday night of Receb month. It
may coincide first, second or seventh day of Receb month. Siyer ( life

  **LÜZÛMÎ VAKIF:** Foundation is in such a position where abolition
of foundation is not possible. There is an agreement about legality of
foundation but its necessity is disputed. According to İmâm-ı A'zam's
even if cretor of a wagf submits dedicated real estate to trustee, this
is not necessary and accordingly cretor of a wagf may give up from
his/her foundation at any time.  But according to the said İmâm-ı A'zam
foundation is necessary in two circumstances. Either with judge's decree
or  through will after his / her death. When judge decides foundation's
necessity foundation becomes necessity and this foundation cannot be
abolished and cancelled. This is called as registration of foundation.
Thus someone makes a foundation through will and afterwards he/she dies
by insisting on his/her will, the said foundation cannot be abolished
and cancelled. According to İmâm-ı Yusuf's judicial opinion foundation
comes into existence as necessary. Its necessity is not subject to
deliver to trustee as it is not in need of judge's decree.

  According to İmâm-ı Muhammed's judicial opinion since foundation
is a grant it does not express necessity as long as foundation is not
submitted to trustee and meşrûtunleh. Revocation from foundation is
possible at any time. But when foundation is submitted trustee or
meşrûtunleh, it is not possible not to abide this circumstance. Although
there is this conflict, those who make foundation take decree related to
his / her foundations' necessity by means of applying to judge.  
Because judge decides under any opinions in legal matters, to make
performance in accordance with that decision is compulsory.

her children become munkarız, children existing in time of foundation
and borning children later are entitled to galle. If founder classifies
his/her children provided that they are existing or mentions by
specifying their names, children borning after founder don't include in
meşrutunleh. For example if founder says that his / her foundation's
galle will be stipulated to his / her living children today or that his
/ her foundation's tevliyet will be stipulated to his / her children,
children borning after founder don't include in condition. Decree even
in descendants is so. In case of condition for descendants, children
living in foundation time or children borning later include in
condition. But if founder cites from his/ her current descendants in
particularly, children borning later don't include in condition.
