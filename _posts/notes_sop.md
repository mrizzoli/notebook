check Concept of solidarity in the Quran

ways to build solidarity through civic action and active participation by citizens


Check organic vs mechanical solidarity in Durkheim

in particular i am curious in which ways active citizenship in the form of associationism divert from the path of the spiral towward democratization building Solidarity and insead realizes political polzarization increasing ingroup solidarity and increasing contrasts with other groups

my argument is that not only Solidarity is to be pursued by a political agenda but also that it depends heavily on how civil associaions actually puts in practice their activities

inquiry the quality vs the quantity of activism

cfr Cultures in interaction pg 50:
>we add another dimension to the question: an inspectionof "culture in interaction" would ask if some of the differences between adherents of the same (religious) beliefs stem from different group styles

Check again the paper on the translation of swiss civil code in turkish and how and what was changed 

following tugal's footsteps we "assume" (?) that turkish civil society has been coopted by the government to pursue its passive revolution in imposing its own hegemony over its subjects, thus as an hypothesis based on Liechterman's and Bugra's theory we can desume that civic actors forged ingroup bonding thus increasing ingroup solidarity at the expense of inter group Solidarity. This peculiar situation exacerbated the already polarized turkish society that we can observe nowadays. Therefore:

###Our working hypothesis is that we should expect third sector actors in Turkey to have a group style that prevent them to forge outward bonds and at the best are able to increase in-group solidarity


Every society contains some form of solidarity that holds it together (Bugra),but we have to distinguish between Solidarity among strangers and solidarity among individuals belonging to the same group of interest, based an ascriptive identity, the former being more inclusive as it doesn't preclude infragroup solidarity but also provide intra groups bonding therefore achieving a wider scope.

Do the kind of bonds that social actors in the third sectore can build depend on the "group style", going beyond the question about reflexivity: it's not just the ability to actually create those long lasting bonds referred to by Tocqueville, Putnam etc, but also the nature of these bonds and the contrapposition between intra group and infra group solidairity

AS Solidarity is conceptualized as a inseparable part of the liberty, equality, solidarity self boosting triangulation, the assumption is that the lack of Solidarity is a reflection of lacking freedoms and equality sa well, denoting a political failure in the process of democratization:
>It is at this point that ascriptive forms of familiarity or a  multiplicity of monocultures could proliferate or even become dominant.

In this view Solidarity becomes part of a political project of democratization and inclusion

The danger of reditributive politics relates to group membership issues when it is a prerequisite to be part of the redistribution, challenging the concept of equal freedom when politics push for a shift from right based welfare to charity based welfare, in this case one possible outcome is the exacerbation of wealth gap between communities that are supposed to be part of the same wider society therefore strengthening inequalities and ingroup solidarity

The pairing of individualism (as in individual freedom) and solidarity can be interpreted as the fullfilment of Neo Tocquevillian interpretation of civil society, but the lack of equal freedom prevents the rise of Solidarity

One of the main assumptions at the basis of comparative analysis, but often also on historical and ethnographic studies, is that the definition given could be applied everywhere, ignoring the fact that it evolved from specific contexts all of them being situated in the "western world". The fact that its struggling to observe similar phenomena in the middle east or in africa (for example) should at least make us wonder if it's a problem of our categories instead of being an issue of incompatibility with those societies (cfr the supposed incompatibility between islam and third sector opposed by Jenny B. White or the incompatibility between liberal democracy and islam proposed by Gellner(check reference) ) Therefore:

### A side "effect" of this research topic is that we would expect to test and challenge the conceptualization of third sector and reshape it accordingly to what non state and non profit actors are in Turkish society
