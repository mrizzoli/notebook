Concept of solidarity in the Quran

ways to build solidarity through civic action and active participation by citizens


Check organic vs mechanical solidarity in Durkheim

in particular i am curious in which ways active citizenship in the form of associationism divert from the path of the spiral towward democratization building Solidarity and insead realizes political polzarization increasing ingroup solidarity and increasing contrasts with other groups

my argument is that not only Solidarity is to be pursued by a political agenda but also that it depends heavily on how civil associaions actually puts in practice their activities

inquiry the quality vs the quantity of activism

cfr Cultures in interaction pg 50:
