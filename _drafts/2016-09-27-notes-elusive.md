## Notes from Elusive Togetherness

From Putnam's study on civil society in Italy and in America we see how civic groip membership has been dropping since 1960s, Lichterman argues that the concept of social capital is not fully adequate to address the issue at hand. In his argument Liechtermann sustains that it's also important to look at the kind and the different meanings of ties that civic groups can build and how these ties can "contribute to a greater civic togetherness in America". In his words: 
> My goal was to understand how different meanings that group gave to ties might influence the relationship they could create as they reached beyond the group.

He also draws a distintion between the political analysis of social problems and the set of customs and practices employed to address them:
> I learned that volunteering often did not build community [..] cultural customs played a subtle, important role in making a broader togetherness elusive for most of the groups.

After the idea of participation in civic groups as decribed by Alexis de Tocqueville these have been seen as playing a prominent role in bolstering social solidarity and building a greater community ("*local workshops of social solidarity*"). But as the author noticed during his fieldwork this assumption is not necessarily and always true, two of the three groups he observed couldn't eventually create those ties with the broader community, not even among themselves as the groups and meetings were discontinued. So the natural question that arises from this observation is, how the group that succeeded was different from those who failed? To which degree the interactions between groups' members influenced the chance of success of spiraling outwards to build greater social ties?

Two main questions are addressed by this study: 

> The social spiral argument, which states that as individuals join civic groups they *tend to* create enduring relationships with other group's members as well as with other individuals who they wouldn't have met under normal circumstances.

> "*Broader ties cultivated by civic groups help to empower civil society, ultimately increasing the collective decision-making responsibilities people carry in their caacity as citizens*" 

One of the arguments of this book is to propose that the meanings of the social ties built matter at least as much as the ties themselves. A secondary one is "*how people bring religion into public life*" and how religion might influence the ways individuals interact (the groups' cutsoms, or customary practices) during groups' activities.
