Every society contains some form of solidarity that holds it together (Bugra),but we have to distinguish between Solidarity among strangers and solidarity among individuals belonging to the same group of interest, based an ascriptive identity, the former being more inclusive as it doesn't preclude infragroup solidarity but also provide intra groups bonding therefore achieving a wider scope.

Do the kind of bonds that social actors in the third sectore can build depend on the "group style", going beyond the question about reflexivity: it's not just the ability to actually create those long lasting bonds referred to by Tocqueville, Putnam etc, but also the nature of these bonds and the contrapposition between intra group and infra group solidairity

AS Solidarity is conceptualized as a inseparable part of the liberty, equality, solidarity self boosting triangulation, the assumption is that the lack of Solidarity is a reflection of lacking freedoms and equality sa well, denoting a political failure in the process of democratization:
>It is at this point that ascriptive forms of familiarityor a  multiplicity of monocultures could proliferate or even become dominant.

In this view Solidarity becomes part of a political project of democratization and inclusion

The danger of reditributive politics relates to group membership issues when it is a prerequisite to be part of the redistribution, challenging the concept of equal freedom when politics push for a shift from right based welfare to charity based welfare, in this case one possible outcome is the exacerbation of wealth gap between communities that are supposed to be part of the same wider society therefore strengthening inequalities and ingroup solidarity

The pairing of individualism (as in individual freedom) and solidarity can be interpreted as the fullfilment of Neo Tocquevillian interpretation of civil society, but the lack of equal freedom prevents the rise of Solidarity
